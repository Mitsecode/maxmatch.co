            information.
        </p>
        <p>A cookie is a small text file that a website or mobile application saves on your computer or mobile
            device
            when you
            access the mobile application. In general, cookies have two main purposes: to improve your browsing
            experience by
            remembering your actions and preferences, and to help us analyze our website traffic.</p>
        <p>We use cookies to help us analyze traffic to the Mobile Application, to help us improve app performance
            and
            usability, and to make the mobile application more secure. Third-party cookies help us use Google
            Analytics,
            firebase and admob to count, track and analyze visits to the Mobile application. This helps us
            understand
            how people
            are using our Mobile Application and where we need to make improvements. These third-party cookies do
            not
            specifically identify you.</p>
        <p><strong>Control cookies</strong></p>
        <p>You are always free to delete cookies that are already on your device through your application settings,
            and
            you can
            set to prevent them from being added to your device.</p>
        <p>• IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</p>
        <p>Our applications are hosted by Google, Facebook and Apple. We will not transfer your personal information
            to
            an
            overseas recipient.</p>
        <h2>• WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h2>
        <p>The Mobile Application may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and
            which may
            link to other websites, online services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and
            privacy
            of data
            you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy
            policy.
            We are
            not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties,
            including other
            websites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the Mobile Application. You should
            review
            the
            policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>
        <h2>• HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
            this
            privacy
            policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
            other
            legal
            requirements).</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
            delete
            or
            anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
            stored in
            backup
            archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
            processing
            until
            deletion is possible.</p>
        <h2>• HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
            security of
            any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the
            internet itself
            is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
            personal
            information to and from our Mobile Application is at your own risk. You should only access the services
            within a
            secure environment.</p>

            consent to
            such
            minor dependent’s use of the Mobile Application. If we learn that personal information from users less
            than
            13 years
            of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
            delete
            such data
            from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please
